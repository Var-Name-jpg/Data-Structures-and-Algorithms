# 📘 CSCI 2210 – Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my personal work for **CSCI 2210**, taught by **Dillon Buchanan**. All code is written in **C#**, unless explicitly labeled otherwise. The repo is organized by assignment and serves both as a personal archive and a reference for others studying similar material.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each assignment is stored in its own folder and typically includes:

- ✅ C# source code  
- 📝 Notes or README (if applicable)  
- 🧪 Test cases or benchmarks (when relevant)  

> 🔹 Non-C# code will be explicitly labeled.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run any assignment:

```bash
cd AssignmentFolderName
dotnet run
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is a personal learning archive and a public reference for others exploring data structures and algorithms. All code is original unless otherwise noted.
