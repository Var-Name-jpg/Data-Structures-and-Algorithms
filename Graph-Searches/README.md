# ⚡ Graph Search Algorithm Benchmarking ⚡

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the fun world of graph algorithms! This project benchmarks 🔍 **DFS**, **BFS**, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm** on weighted directed graphs with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 edges. We analyze performance based on ⏱️ runtime, 🔢 step count, and 🛣️ path cost.

## 📂 Project Contents
- 💻 Source code implementing graph algorithms (C#)
- 🗂️ Graph edge data files (CSV format)
- 📊 Raw output traversal logs for each algorithm and graph size
- 📄 Detailed report with analysis and charts (.docx & markdown)
- 📈 Visual charts comparing performance metrics (PNG)

## 🎯 Key Findings
- 🥇 **Dijkstra** finds the lowest cost paths consistently but with a runtime cost.
- ⚡ **BFS** is the fastest for smaller graphs but struggles with weighted paths.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **DFS** explores deeply and blindly, leading to inefficient paths on large graphs.
- 🚶‍♂️ BFS explores broadly, while Dijkstra explores more strategically.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Load graph data into the graph code.
2. Run each algorithm for your target graph sizes.
3. Collect and analyze runtime, steps, and path costs.
4. Review the comprehensive report for insights.

## 🌐 Real-World Uses
